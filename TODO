 - Verification
   - Local
 - Handle login page customization (maybe?)
 - Rename ServerSecret to SessionSecret
 - Cookie
   - Needs versionning for format changes (or just invalid and expect to re-issue?)
   - Move checksum to front so all can be verified *before* as much parsing as possible
   - CookieClear should simply invoke SendSignedCookie() [duplication]
   - [bug] Cookie path is wrong when persona is configured with anything but <VirtualHost> or <Location>

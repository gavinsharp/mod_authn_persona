 - Perform local verification
 - Handle login page customization (maybe?)
 - Cache headers? Cache-control: no-store, Vary: Cookie, what?
 - Cookie
   - Needs versionning for format changes (or just invalid and expect to re-issue?)
   - Cookie path needs to be based on current location
 - Server configuration
   - move most configuration to per-location, not per-server
 - Need an AuthPersonaAuthoritative directive
 - Logout handler not really implemented yet
   - Needs to verify someone is already logged-in, otherwise, free redirector
